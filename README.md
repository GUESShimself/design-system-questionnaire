# Design System Questionnaire
A one-page questionnaire to help your organization establish effective design systems and style guides.

# Basic Information
- **What is the name of the design system?** - A catchy and rememberable name can help a solid design system gain traction. The name of the design system should embody the spirit of the organization and the system's underlying design principles. Fair warning: naming is hard.

# Parts
**A design system is a collection of components, guidelines, documentation, points of view, processes, and tools.** What ingredients should your organization's design system contain? No doubt your organization's structure, processes, and tools will all influence the design system's ingredients. I recommend checking out Nathan Curtis's [Picking Parts, People, and Products](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/picking-parts-products-people-a06721e81742#.iy6eas2rw) for a great exercise to help prioritize what the system should include. 

Let's take a look at some of the parts that your design system can include:

## Brand Identity
- **Does the design system include brand identity elements?** - These guidelines include brand-wide elements such as logo, typography, color, tagline, marketing guidelines, etc.
- **How does the design system make use of brand assets and elements?** - What is the relationship between the overall brand identity and UI components. D
- **Are you using any third-party tools or services to manage brand assets?** - Some of these tools include:
  - [Brand.ai](http://brand.ai/)
  - [Frontify](https://frontify.com/)
  
## Principles
- **What design principles does your design system embrace?** [Design principles](https://principles.adactio.com/) underpin every aspect of the design system, and influence its construction. 

Here are some good resources about design principles:
- [Styleguides.io examples](http://styleguides.io/examples.html) - Many public style guides showcase their design principles
- [Design principle roundup](https://principles.adactio.com/) by Jeremy Keith rounds up a ton of principles from a ton of different fields.
- [Creating Design Principles](https://articles.uie.com/creating-design-principles/) - Jared Spool talks about the qualities of effective design principles.

## High-level Guidelines
What are some high-level guidelines you want to codify in the design system? Some examples may include:

- Accessibility
- Animation
- Data display
- Data entry
- Data validation
- Multi-device design
- Layout
- Navigation
- Performance

While these topics will manifest themselves in more concrete ways at the component level, it's often a good idea to explicitly express the organization's point of view on these topics at a high level.

## Content
- **Do you have over-arching content strategy guidelines in place?**
- **Do you follow writing guidelines?** - What conventions should people writing on behalf of your organization follow? Check out [Dalhousie University's writing for the web](https://www.dal.ca/webteam/web_style_guide/writing_for_the_web.html) guide for a great example.
- **Do you have voice and tone guideslines in place?** - What qualities does your brand's voice embrace? How does your brand's tone change based on audience, context, and environment? The answers to these questions should be embodied in the voice and tone guidelines. For inspiration, check out:
  - [MailChimp's Voice and Tone](http://voiceandtone.com/)
  - [MailChimp's Content Style Guide](http://styleguide.mailchimp.com/voice-and-tone/)

## UI Components
- **What UI components are included in the system?** - Form fields, cards, tabs, and much more can be present in your organization's design system. Which UI components that  [Conducting an interface inventory](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/conducting-an-interface-inventory/) can be a good way to determine which UI components should be codified in the design system.
- **Does your team use a methodology to organize components?** Such as [atomic design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#the-atomic-design-methodology)?

## Page templates
- **Should the design system include common page templates?** dashboard, blog post, etc

## Workflows
- If UI components are the tools in the toolshed, then workflows are the common tasks you do with those tools.

- **Are there teams or people in the organization that won't use the design system?** Why? What do they do instead?
