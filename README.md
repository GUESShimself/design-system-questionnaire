1. Sell
2. Kickoff
3. Plan
4. Design and Build
5. Launch
6. Maintain

-------
# 1. Sell

## Problems and Opportunities
**Why do you want to create a design system?** What problems does the design system need to address in your organization?

**What are the goals you want to accomplish in establishing a design system?** - The [benefits of design systems](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-1/#style-guide-benefits) are many, but what specifically are the goals of your organization's design system initiative?

**What will happen if this initiative fails?**

## People
**Who needs convinced?** Which departments or people in your organization need convinced that establishing a design system is a good idea? 

**Who's doing the convincing?** Who is involved at convincing stakeholders, management, securing funding, etc?

-------
# 2. Kickoff

## User Research
**Who are the users and stakeholders of the design system?** It's important to understand the needs of the people who will be affected by the design system. Conducting interviews with makers, users, and stakeholders helps the team better understand what the design system needs to be in order to be successful.

**Who will conduct user/stakeholder interviews?** 

**Who will be interviewed?** - It's important to interview a healthy cross-section of product teams, disciplines, skill levels, and perspectives in order to ensure the design system initiative properly serves the organization.

**What are the broad themes uncovered by the interviews?** What pain do people experience, and how can the design system aliviate that pain?

## Kickoff workshop
The kickoff workshop is used to kick off the design system initiative and establish a broad consensus about what the design system is and .

**Who needs to be present at the kickoff workshop?** The kickoff meeting attendees should be stakeholders who will influence and/or be influenced by the design system. Who should be present to ensure proper representation across products and disciplines?
 
**What are the shared outcomes and priorities of the design system initiative?** This is the result of the kickoff session and interviews.

**Who is responsible for taking the outcomes of the kickoff workshop and translating them into a plan of attack?**

# 3. Plan

## Principles
- **What design principles does your design system embrace?** Design principles underpin every aspect of the design system, and influence its construction. They should jive with your organization's broader mission and culture, and your design principles should be easily understood by everyone doing work with the design system.

Here are some good resources about design principles:
- [Styleguides.io examples](http://styleguides.io/examples.html) - Many public style guides showcase their design principles
- [Design Principles FTW](http://www.designprinciplesftw.com/) - A big collection of design principles.
- [Design principle roundup](https://principles.adactio.com/) by Jeremy Keith rounds up a ton of principles from a ton of different fields.
- [Creating Design Principles](https://articles.uie.com/creating-design-principles/) - Jared Spool talks about the qualities of effective design principles.
- [Shaping Our Design Principles](https://medium.com/building-creative-market/shaping-our-design-principles-3474d6f5204b)

## Products
**What products will the design system serve?** - List the products the design system will be applied to. 

**Are there products that will not be served by the design system?** Why? What will those products use instead? List the products that won't make use of the design system and discuss why they won't utilize the design system.

**What are the design system's pilot projects?** - Design system pilot projects put the design system through its paces as it's being constructed. Which projects Keep in mind that pilot projects should provide a healthy cross-section of components, patterns, technologies, processes, and people. Read Dan Mall's [Design System: Pilots and Scorecards](http://danmall.me/articles/design-systems-pilots-scorecards/) for criteria for choosing design system scorecards.

## Technology
**What platforms does the design system apply to?** (Web, iOS, Android, Windows, etc)




## Code Guidelines
**What frontend guidelines does the design system follow?** Frontend guidelines - For more information, check out [Frontend Guidelines Questionnaire](https://github.com/bradfrost/frontend-guidelines-questionnaire) that's similar in format to this questionnaire.

# 4. Design & Build

Do it!

# 5. Launch

**What is the name of the design system?** - A catchy and memorable name can help your design system gain traction. The name of the design system should embody the spirit of the organization and the system's underlying design principles. Fair warning: naming is hard. 

**Where does the style guide live?** - The style guide (the container that houses the guts of the design system) should live at an easy-to-access and easy-to-remember URL (i.e. designsystem.yourcompany.com)

**Is your style guide publicly accessible?** (Yes, no, maybe, eventually). Making a style guide public [has many benefits](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-5/#make-it-public).

**What [tool](http://styleguides.io/tools.html) are you using to house your style guide?** - What tech is your style guide built on? What's its relationship to the style guide website to the components that make up your design system? 

## What does the design system include?
**A design system is a collection of components, guidelines, documentation, points of view, processes, and tools.** What ingredients should your organization's design system contain? No doubt your organization's structure, processes, and tools will all influence the design system's ingredients. I recommend checking out Nathan Curtis's [Picking Parts, People, and Products](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/picking-parts-products-people-a06721e81742#.iy6eas2rw) for a great exercise to help prioritize what the system should include. 

Let's take a look at some of the parts that your design system can include:

## Brand Identity
- **Where are brand identity guidelines managed?** - These  include brand-wide elements such as logo, typography, color, tagline, marketing guidelines, etc.
- **What is the relationship between the overall brand identity and UI components?** - There may be a tight relationship between the brand guidelines and UI (i.e. buttons and logo are, and must be, the same color) or there may be a loose relationship (i.e. Material Design's guidelines and Google's brand guidelines are quite different).
- **Are you using any third-party tools or services to manage brand assets?** - Some of these tools include:
  - [Brand.ai](http://brand.ai/)
  - [Frontify](https://frontify.com/)



## High-level Guidelines
What are some high-level guidelines you want to provide in the design system? Some examples may include:

- Accessibility
- Animation
- Data display
- Data entry
- Data validation
- Multi-device design
- Layout
- Navigation
- Performance

While these topics will manifest themselves in more concrete ways at the component level, it's often a good idea to explicitly express the organization's point of view on these topics at a high level.

## Content
- **Do you have over-arching content strategy guidelines in place?**
- **Do you follow writing guidelines?** - What conventions should people writing on behalf of your organization follow? Check out [Dalhousie University's writing for the web](https://www.dal.ca/webteam/web_style_guide/writing_for_the_web.html) guide for a great example.
- **Do you have voice and tone guidelines in place?** - What qualities does your brand's 
embrace? How does your brand's tone change based on audience, context, and environment? The answers to these questions should be embodied in the voice and tone guidelines. For inspiration, check out:
  - [MailChimp's Voice and Tone](http://voiceandtone.com/)
