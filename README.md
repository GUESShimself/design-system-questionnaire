# Design System Questionnaire
A one-page questionnaire to help your organization establish effective design systems and style guides.

# Basic Information
- **What is the name of the design system?** - A catchy and rememberable name can help a solid design system gain traction. The name of the design system should embody the spirit of the organization and the system's underlying design principles. Fair warning: naming is hard.

# Parts
**A design system is a collection of components, guidelines, documentation, points of view, processes, and tools.** What ingredients does your organization's design system contain? I recommend checking out Nathan Curtis's [Picking Parts, People, and Products](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/picking-parts-products-people-a06721e81742#.iy6eas2rw) for a great exercise to help prioritize what the system need to include. 

Let's take a look at some of the parts that your design system can include:

## Brand Identity
- **Does the design system include brand identity elements?** - These guidelines include brand-wide elements such as logo, typography, color, tagline, marketing guidelines, etc.
- **How does the design system make use of brand assets and elements?** - What is the relationship between the overall brand identity and UI components. D
- **Are you using any third-party tools or services to manage brand assets?** - Some of these tools include:
  - [Brand.ai](http://brand.ai/)
  - [Frontify](https://frontify.com/)
  
## Principles
- **What design principles does your design system embrace?** [Design principles](https://principles.adactio.com/) underpin every aspect of the design system, and influence its construction. 

Here are some good resources about design principles:
- [Styleguides.io examples](http://styleguides.io/examples.html) - Many public style guides showcase their design principles
- [Design principle roundup](https://principles.adactio.com/) by Jeremy Keith rounds up a ton of principles from a ton of different fields.
- [Creating Design Principles](https://articles.uie.com/creating-design-principles/) - Jared Spool talks about the qualities of effective design principles.

## High-level Guidelines
What are some high-level guidelines you want to codify in the design system? Some examples may include:

- Accessibility
- Animation
- Data display
- Data entry
- Data validation
- Multi-device design
- Layout
- Navigation
- Performance

While these topics will manifest themselves in more concrete ways at the component level, it's often a good idea to explicitly express the organization's point of view on these topics at a high level.

# People
- **Who are the primary users of the design system?** Who are the people that will be primarily be implementing the system's components, reading guidelines, and referencing the information in the style guide?
- **Who are the secondary users of the design system?** Secondary users are people who may not rely on the system for their day-to-day work but may find the docuementation and information in the style guide useful.
- **Are there teams or people in the organization that won't use the design system?** Why? What do they do instead?
- **Who are the prmimary [design system makers](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-5/#design-system-makers)?** - Who is responsible for creating and maintaining the design system? Provide names and roles. 
- **How is the design system team structured?** Solidatary? Centralized? Federated? How the design system team is structured influences its adoptation and ongoing success. For more info, read:

  - [Establishing a Design System Team](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-5/#establishing-a-design-system-team) 
- **Who is the primary owner of the design system?** - Who is the primary person responsible for the design system's success or failure? This person is often in a senior leadership or director position.
- **Who are the key stakeholders in the design systems?** - Who will primarily affect or be affected by the design system?
- **Who are secondary stakeholders?** - Are there other people who either have 
- **Are there third parties involved?** - Are there any players outside of the organization (agencies, consultants, who will affect or be affected by the design system?

# Products

- **What products will the design system serve?** - List the products the design system will be applied to. 
- **Are there products that will not be served by the design system?** Why? What will those products use instead? List the products that won't make use of the design system and discuss why they won't
- **What are the design system's pilot projects?** - Pilot projects are often used to simultaneously create the pieces of the  design system while. Are there projects that should be used to construct the design system? Keep in mind that pilot projects should 
- **What technologies does the design system apply to?** (Web, iOS, Android, Windows, etc) - Different products and organizations use different technologies. Is the design system only relevant to your organization's web properties?

# Deployment
- **How are design system's components deployed into applications?** See
[Chasing the Holy Grail: Strategies For Distributing Your Pattern Library and Keeping It in Sync](https://medium.com/@marcelosomers/chasing-the-holy-grail-bbc0b7cce365#.3gjztlqve) for various strategies on how to deploy
- **How is versioning handled?**
- **How are dependencies managed?**

---------------

# Communication
- **What communication channels are used to talk about the design system?** - The design system should plug into the organization's existing communication structure. Slack? Yammer? HipChat? Basecamp? Wikis? Blogs? Email newsletters?
- **What steps are taken when the design system is updated?** Release notes? Blog post? Email newsletter? Smoke signals?

---------------

# Contributing 
- **Who can contribute to the design system?** - Can every user directly contribute patterns or modifications to the design system's components and guidelines? Or is it on lockdown and only managed by a . On the spectrum from wipe open to lockdown, where does your design system stand?
- **What does the contributing process look like?** - Pull requests? Simple feature requests? Prototypes? See [modifying patterns](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-5/#making-changes-to-patterns)

---------------

# Style Guide
- **Where does the style guide live?** - The style guide (the container that houses the guts of the design system) should live at an easy-to-access and easy-to-remember URL.
- **Is your style guide publicly accessible?** (Yes, no, maybe, eventually). Making a style guide public [has many benefits](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-5/#make-it-public).
- **Are you using a [pattern library tool](http://styleguides.io/tools.html) to house your style guide?** -
