# Design System Questionnaire
A one-page questionnaire to help your organization establish an effective design systems and style guides.

# Basic Information

- **What is the name of the design system?** - A catchy and rememberable name can help a solid design system gain traction. The name of the design system should embody the spirit of the organization and the design system initiative. Fair warning: naming is hard. 
- **Where does the style guide live?** - The style guide (the container that houses the guts of the design system) should live in an easy-to-access location.
- **Is your style guide publicly accessible?** (Yes, no, maybe, eventually). Making a style guide public [has many benefits](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-5/#make-it-public).

# Principles
- **What design principles does your design system embrace?** [Design principles](https://principles.adactio.com/) underpin and influence every aspect of the design system. These 

Good resources about design principles:
- [Design principle roundup](https://principles.adactio.com/) by Jeremy Keith rounds up a ton of principles from a ton of different fields.
- [Style guides examples](http://styleguides.io/examples.html) - Many public style guides showcase their design principles
- [Creating Design Principles](https://articles.uie.com/creating-design-principles/) - Jared Spool talks about the qualities of effective design principles.

## JavaScript

### JavaScript Principles
- **What are some general principles your team should follow when writing JavaScript?** *(See [these](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) [resources](https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js) for [inspiration](https://github.com/styleguide/javascript))*


### JavaScript tools
- **Are you using a JavaScript framework** *(such as [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Ember](http://emberjs.com/), [Angular](https://angularjs.org/), etc)*?
- **Where is the documentation for those frameworks?**
- **Are you using any polyfills or shims** *(such as [any of these](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-Browser-Polyfills))*?
- **What third-party scripts are dependencies for your project** *(such as scripts for form validation, graphs, animation, etc)*?
- **Do you test your JavaScript?** If so, what tools do you use *(such as [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/), [Karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma), [Selenium](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/), etc)*?

### JavaScript Style 
*(See [these](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) [resources](https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js) for [inspiration](https://github.com/styleguide/javascript))*
- **Spaces or Tabs?**
- **What does JS commenting look like?** 
- **What patterns are you following?** *(See [these](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/) [resources](https://shichuan.github.io/javascript-patterns/))*

---------------

## Media
- **How are you handling icons** *(such as using SVG, icon fonts, etc)*?
- **How are you handling responsive images** *(such as using `srcset` & `<picture />`)*?
- **Are you using any [tools](https://addyosmani.com/blog/image-optimization-tools/) to optimize and serve images**?

---------------

## Fonts
- **How do you load custom fonts?**
- **Do you use any tools to help implement web fonts** *(such as [Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/), etc)*?
- **Do you use a service to manage and serve custom fonts** *(such as [Fonts.com](https://www.fonts.com/), [Typekit](https://typekit.com/), etc)*?


---------------

## Performance
- **Do you use performance budgets?** If so, what [metrics](https://timkadlec.com/2014/11/performance-budget-metrics/) are you using to determine budgets? Where are you keeping track of performance budgets?
- **How are you measuring your project's speed** *(such as [Pingdom Speed Test](http://tools.pingdom.com/) or [Google PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/))*?

-----------

## Support and Optimization
It's important to recognize the difference between ["support" and "optimization"](http://bradfrost.com/blog/mobile/support-vs-optimization/). You should do your best to support as many environments as possible while simultaneously optimizing for the environments that make the most sense for your business and users. 

- **What browsers are you *optimizing* for?** 
- **What devices are you *optimizing* for?** 
- **Are you using a [graded browser support](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Graded-Browser-Support) system?**
- **Are there specific components that require [more specific grading](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/grade-the-components.html)?** 

-----------

## Localization
- **Is your website served in different languages?** If so, what considerations do you need to address when localizing for other languages?

-----------

## Deployment/Integration
- **How is your front-end code integrated into a production environment?**

-----------

## Documentation
- **Are you using a [pattern library tool](http://styleguides.io/tools.html) to document your front-end architecture?**
- **Where does your documentation live?** What are the links to the documentation?
- **Who's responsible for maintaining and governing the documentation?**
- **What happens when the guidelines are updated?**
