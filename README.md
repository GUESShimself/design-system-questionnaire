# Design System Questionnaire
A one-page questionnaire to help your organization establish effective design systems and style guides.

# Basic Information

- **What is the name of the design system?** - A catchy and rememberable name can help a solid design system gain traction. The name of the design system should embody the spirit of the organization and the system's underlying design principles. Fair warning: naming is hard. 
- **Where does the style guide live?** - The style guide (the container that houses the guts of the design system) should live at an easy-to-access and easy-to-remember URL.
- **Is your style guide publicly accessible?** (Yes, no, maybe, eventually). Making a style guide public [has many benefits](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-5/#make-it-public).

-------

# Principles
- **What design principles does your design system embrace?** [Design principles](https://principles.adactio.com/) underpin every aspect of the design system, and influence its construction. 

Here are some good resources about design principles:
- [Styleguides.io examples](http://styleguides.io/examples.html) - Many public style guides showcase their design principles
- [Design principle roundup](https://principles.adactio.com/) by Jeremy Keith rounds up a ton of principles from a ton of different fields.
- [Creating Design Principles](https://articles.uie.com/creating-design-principles/) - Jared Spool talks about the qualities of effective design principles.

# People
- **Who are the primary users of the design system?** Who are the people that will be primarily be implementing the system's components, reading guidelines, and referencing the information in the style guide?
- **Who are the secondary users of the design system?** Secondary users are people who may not rely on the system for their day-to-day work but may find the docuementation and information in the style guide useful.
- **Who are the prmimary [design system makers](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-5/#design-system-makers)?** - Who is responsible for creating and maintaining the design system? Provide names and roles. 
- **How is the design system team structured?** Solidatary? Centralized? Federated?
