# Design System Questionnaire
A one-page questionnaire to help your organization establish effective design systems and style guides.

# Basic Information
- **What is the name of the design system?** - A catchy and rememberable name can help a solid design system gain traction. The name of the design system should embody the spirit of the organization and the system's underlying design principles. Fair warning: naming is hard.

# People
- **Who are the primary users of the design system?** Who are the people that will be primarily be implementing the system's components, reading guidelines, and referencing the information in the style guide?

# Parts
What does the design system contain? I definitely recommend checking out Nathan Curtis's [Picking Parts, People, and Products](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/picking-parts-products-people-a06721e81742#.iy6eas2rw) for a great exercise to help prioritize what the system need to include.

# Principles
- **What design principles does your design system embrace?** [Design principles](https://principles.adactio.com/) underpin every aspect of the design system, and influence its construction. 

Here are some good resources about design principles:
- [Styleguides.io examples](http://styleguides.io/examples.html) - Many public style guides showcase their design principles
- [Design principle roundup](https://principles.adactio.com/) by Jeremy Keith rounds up a ton of principles from a ton of different fields.

[Chasing the Holy Grail: Strategies For Distributing Your Pattern Library and Keeping It in Sync](https://medium.com/@marcelosomers/chasing-the-holy-grail-bbc0b7cce365#.3gjztlqve) for various strategies on how to deploy
- **How is versioning handled?**
- **How are dependencies managed?**

---------------

# Communication
- **What communication channels are used to talk about the design system?** - The design system should plug into the organization's existing communication structure. Slack? Yammer? HipChat? Basecamp? Wikis? Blogs? Email newsletters?

- **What does the contributing process look like?** - Pull requests? Simple feature requests? Prototypes? See [modifying patterns](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-5/#making-changes-to-patterns)

---------------

# Style Guide
- **Where does the style guide live?** - The style guide (the container that houses the guts of the design system) should live at an easy-to-access and easy-to-remember URL.
- **Is your style guide publicly accessible?** (Yes, no, maybe, eventually). Making a style guide public [has many benefits](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-5/#make-it-public).
- **Are you using a [pattern library tool](http://styleguides.io/tools.html) to house your style guide?** -
